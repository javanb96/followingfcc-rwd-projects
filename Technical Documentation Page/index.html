            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of it's environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, Such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects, for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevent to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to place elements on
              an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form
              input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system of classes based
            on a small number of data types representing numeric, boolean, and
            string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead
            of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based
            model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can
            vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions
            without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be
            properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scrathpad and write
            your first "Hello World!" Javascript code:
          </p>
          <code
            >function greetMe(yourname) {alert("Hello " + yourName + "!"); }
            greetMe("World");</code
          >
          <p>
            Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
            browser!
          </p>
          <p>Other code examples include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Declaring variables:
              <code>x = 42.</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Variable scopes:
              <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Constants:
              <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              If-Else statements:
              <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>

        <header>Data Types</header>
        <article>
          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false</li>
                <li>
                  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                  JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                  NULL, or any other varient.
                </li>
                <li>
                  undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                </li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>
                  Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                  are unique and immutable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><p>and Object</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
            you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
            functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You
            can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions
            as procedures that your application can perform.
